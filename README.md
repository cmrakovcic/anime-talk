# AnimeTalk

# Introduction
AnimeTalk is a SPA with a Rails API backend, and a JavaScript Frontend. While on AnimeTalk if you see a Anime that you have watched, you can leave a review about that anime. If you have watched an Anime that is not yet added to the list, you can go ahead and create an Anime which will then be added to the list.

# Usage
To get started you will want to clone the repository for this app.
In order to get AnimeTalk started you will want to:
  - 'cd backend' 
  - 'bundle install'
  - 'rails db:migrate'
  - 'rails db:seed'
  - 'rails s'

Then, open up a second terminal tab:
  - 'cd frontend'
  - 'open index.html'

You can then use the AnimeTalk app, which has some seed data.
